### Small biography

I've lived in Clarksville, TN most of my life, I'm currently working towards getting my bachelors degree in Computer Science at Austin Peay State University, and I just recently celebrated two years of marriage to my wonderful wife. 

I'm pretty much addicted to my computer. Between homework and personal projects I probably spend close to 90% of my spare time at it. 

In addition to being a student, I currently serve in the United States Army Reserves as a [Horizontal Contruction Engineer.](https://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/browse-career-and-job-categories/construction-engineering/construction-equipment-operator.html) 


Fun fact: I joined the Army Reserves in 2012, was deployed for all of 2014, got married in 2016, and will graduate college in 2018. So I guess all of my major life events happen during even numbered years. :)

### Programming competition

Recently, on November 4th 2017, I got to participate in the Regional ACM Programming Contest 2017.
It was a great experience and a ton of fun. [There's an article about it!](http://www.apsu.edu/news/November-2017-computer-sci-students.php)
