This is my website which I post my projects, thoughts, and some information for anyone who wants to get to know me better.

This site was made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and it uses a _very_ slightly modified version of [joshgerdes](https://github.com/joshgerdes)'s [Jekyll-uno theme](https://github.com/joshgerdes/jekyll-uno).
